**gshare** was created to address my issue of finding the right photo sharing solution. As a photographer, my wife needs to share a substantial amount of photos with her clients. There are many commercial options available, but after extensive searching we couldn't find a great option. Below are some of the downsides we found during our search:

- Image compression
- Unfriendly UI/UX (client and/or admin)
- Lack of customization
- Expensive
- No control over our data

Some commercial options are better than others, but none that we could find seemed to meet all of our criteria. With that said, the clear solution was something we could host ourselves. After further searching, it appeared that there weren't any self-hosted solutions dedicated to sharing images. There are plenty of photo storage and backup solutions available, but most of them lack sharing capabilities. Those that have the ability to share, are lacking in features. This is not a criticism of those projects, as they are not built with this use-case at the forefront.

I hope to create something that can start to check off more of those boxes. The priority for **gshare** was to solve those main downsides we identified above, but there are many other nice-to-haves that I would like to implement in the future.
