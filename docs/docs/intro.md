**gshare** was created to address my issue of finding the right photo sharing solution. As a photographer, my wife needs to share a substantial amount of photos with her clients. There are many commercial options available, but after extensive searching we couldn't find a great option. Below are some of the downsides we found during our search:

- Compression
- Unfriendly UI/UX (on both client and admin sides)
- Lack of customization
- Expense

Some commercial options are better than others, but none that we could find seemed to meet all of our criteria. With that said, the clear solution was something we could host ourselves. Another benefit to self-hosting is the ability to control our own data. After further searching, it appeared that there weren't any self-hosted solutions dedicated to sharing images. There are plenty of photo storage and backup solutions available, but most of them lack sharing capabilities. Those that have the ability to share, are lacking in features. This is not a criticism of those projects, as they are not built to handle the professional sharing of photographs.

I hope to create something that can start to check off more of those boxes. The priority for **gshare** was to solve those main four downsides we identified above, but there are many other nice-to-haves that I would like to implement in the future.
