There is an **optional** custom hero image on galleries. This creates a nice landing page with one of your favorite images from the gallery to display.

:::note[Disable]
You can disable the hero image in the gallery settings if you prefer not to have it.

## Default Gallery Hero

Here is an example of the **default hero image** in action. The default hero displays the featured image over the entire screen. It displays your logo in the center with the gallery title below and a button that will scroll you to the top of the gallery section.

## Alt-1 Gallery Hero

Here is an example of the **alt-1 hero image** in action. The first alternate hero displays the featured image over half of the screen. It displays your logo in the center with the gallery title in the top left corner with the photographer's name below.

### Randomized

When hero is enabled and you don't have a featured image selected, the hero image will be selected randomly with priority on the images with landscape orientation. So, if you can't decide on one, gshare will randomly select one for you! ðŸ˜Š
