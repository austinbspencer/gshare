There is an **optional** custom hero image on galleries. This creates a nice landing page with one of your favorite images from the gallery to display.

## Gallery Hero

Here is an example of the hero image in action.

:::note[Disable]
You can disable the hero image in the gallery settings if you prefer not to have it.

### Randomized

When hero is enabled and you don't have a featured image selected, the hero image will be selected randomly with priority on the images with landscape orientation. So, if you can't decide on one, gshare will randomly select one for you! ðŸ˜Š
