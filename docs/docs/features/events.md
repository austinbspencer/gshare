title: Event Tracking
---

An **event** is captured each time a user downloads a file from your gallery.

You can view all events for a gallery by going to the admin portal for the gallery and clicking on the `EVENTS` tab near the top.

Currently, an event will track the gallery, image, requestor IP address, filename, resolution, and size.

## Purpose

The reason for capturing this data is to see which images are most popular in the galleries. Also, this can be good insight into whether the client has actually viewed and downloaded any images. You can do with this data what you will or ignore it entirely.

## Demo

In this demo you can see there are 3 separate events for the gallery.
