You can opt to have galleries password-protected at the gallery level. If you choose to have a gallery protected, the client will be required to enter the password before they can view the gallery.

## Protected Galleries

If you decide to password-protect your gallery, you would need to input the password. This allows you to be worry free that the intended clients for these images are the only ones with access. You may want this if you're worried about the privacy of your clients or if the images you are sharing are sensitive.

### Demo

When the gallery is protected and a client goes to the gallery they will see the below page. This page has the featured image in the background blurred. The purpose of still showing a blurred version of the featured image is so the client can confirm they are at the correct gallery. Once the client inputs the correct password, they will gain full access to the gallery.

Keep in mind that the featured image can still be retrieved (at a low quality) without the blur if the bad actor has any technical knowledge.
