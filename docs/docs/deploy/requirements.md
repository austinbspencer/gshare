Hardware and software requirements for **gshare**

## Software

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

:::info Node & Go
You can run the application from source with Node and Go installed on your machine but **Docker** is highly recommended.
:::

## Hardware

- **OS**: Unix-based operating system is best (Ubuntu, Debian, MacOS, etc). Windows works too, with [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
  - Docker Image supports amd64 and arm64
- **RAM**: gshare should sip resources. 1GB of RAM should be more than enough.
