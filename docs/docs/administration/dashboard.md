title: Admin Portal
---

The admin portal is what we'll call the admin section of your gshare application. To access the admin portal you must manually add the `/admin` to your gshare web app url.

:::tip[URL location]
Example: If your web app is at `https://gshare.photography.com` you would need to go to `https://gshare.photography.com/admin` for access to the admin portal.
:::

Once you go to this url, you will either be redirected to the dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) or the login page (`/admin/login`) depending on your authentication status.
