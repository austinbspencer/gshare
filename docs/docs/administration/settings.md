Currently, the only settings you can change from within the gshare application are your admin account's login credentials.

## Update login credentials

Once you're within the [admin portal](./dashboard.md), you should be able to see a settings or gear icon âš™ in the upper right next to the `LOGOUT` button.

If you click the settings icon you will be taken to the admin settings page (`/admin/settings`). From here you can update your email and/or password.
